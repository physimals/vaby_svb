Stochastic Variational Bayes
============================

``SVB`` is a package to perform stochastic Bayesian inference on a nonlinear 
forward model (i.e. a parameterised model which is able to predict data
values from a set of parameter values).

The implementation leverages the TensorFlow framework to perform efficient
optimisation of the model parameters given an experimental data set.
